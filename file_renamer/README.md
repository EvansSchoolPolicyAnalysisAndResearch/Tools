File Renamer

This script was developed by the Evans School Policy Analysis & Research Group (EPAR) to update the names of files in a directory based on the name of their parent folder. The script will recursively enter all folders within a folder as-needed. The initial use case was appending the grant number to the set of files shared for that grant.

There are no specific inputs and outputs.
