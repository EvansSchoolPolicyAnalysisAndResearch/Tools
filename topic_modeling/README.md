Topic Modeling

This script was developed by the Evans School Policy Analysis & Research Group (EPAR) to perform topic modeling on a group of documents. The initial use case was looking for undiscovered insights among grant proposals around initiatives by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, but this script can be adapted for any purpose.

The input is a directory of documents (in doc or docx file type)

The output is a csv file with the results of the topic modeling exercise, notably the propensity of each document's fit to each topic and the top keywords for each topic, repeated for the range in number of topics the user provided.

* Example input directory: Documents 
* Example output: example_topic_modeling_output.xlsx
