Pdfextractor

This script was developed by the Evans School Policy Analysis & Research Group (EPAR) to retrieve PDFs from the first page of Google Results based on a list of search queries, as well as produce a ledger with the most relevant PDFs sorted to the top. The initial use case was looking for regulations related to digital credit in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.

The input is a csv of search queries. 

The outputs are a directory with the extracted PDFs and a spreadsheet with the most relevant PDFs sorted to the top, hereon referred to as the "top pdfs ledger". 

* Example input csv: web_input_search_terms.csv
* Example top pdfs ledger: pdfs_extracted.xlsx

Tip: If you have a long list of search queries, the program may be blocked at some point. To prevent this from happening, we recommend downloading the (free) tool Windscribe (https://windscribe.com/) and encrypt your browsing activity.
